\label{sec:intro}

The Verification Control Document (VCD) is a detailed look at where we are in verifying our requirements e.g. \citeds{LSE-61}.
We verify requirements by
running tests, the results of which are recorded in Jira.  A description of how the verification testing is set up is given in Section 2 of \citeds{LDM-503}.
Specifically, Section 2.3.2 of \citeds{LDM-503} describes the verification elements and test cases which appear in \secref{sec:vcd}.

In general the summary provided in \secref{sec:summary} will give the reader an overview. The remainder of the document is a large matrix of all the DM requirements , their verification elements, their tests, and if those tests have been run.

The matrix is fully linked --- any given Test Case mentioned in the matrix such as \jira{LVV-T362} provides a link to the Jira element defining that test case. 
Similarly, relevant documentation such as test reports like \citeds{DMTR-111} are linked to the bibliography which provides a link to the document.
If you are browsing with a browser-based PDF reader it is extremely useful to know that if you follow a hyperlink in the document the  apple $\leftarrow$\footnote{This should be ctrl $\leftarrow$ on windows/Linux} takes you back to where you clicked.

This reference document is not designed for casual perusal but instead provides a good view on the Jira system in which all of the same information may be found (apart from the summaries).
