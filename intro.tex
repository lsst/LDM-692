\label{sec:intro}

The requirements on the LSST Data Management System are described in \citeds{LSE-61} and in the various lower-level 
requirements documents (e.g. \citeds{LDM-554}, \citeds{LDM-555}, \citeds{LDM-636}, etc), all of which are derived from \citeds{LSE-61}.
These requirements are verified by running tests, and recording the results of those tests in the LSST Jira system.
The general approach to testing and verification in DM is described in more detail in \citeds{LDM-503}; note, in particular, the concepts and vocabulary described in \citeds{LDM-503} \S2.3.2.

This Verification Control Document (VCD) provides a summary of the status of requirements verification: which requirements are covered by which tests, and how many of those tests have been executed successfully.
Section \ref{sec:summary} presents a brief overview; the remainder of the document provides a matrix displaying all of the DM requirements, their corresponding verification elements, the applicable tests, and whether those tests have been executed.

The matrix is fully linked: any given test case mentioned in the matrix such as, \jira{LVV-T362}, provides a link to the Jira element defining that test case.
Similarly, relevant documentation such as test reports like \citeds{DMTR-111} are linked to the bibliography and thence to the report itself\footnote{As such, you may find it useful to remember the appropriate keyboard shortcuts --- often \cmdkey{}+\texttt{[} (macOS) or \texttt{ctrl}+{$\leftarrow$ (Windows/Linux}) --- to return to your previous position.}.
